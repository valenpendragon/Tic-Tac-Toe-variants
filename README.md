 This started out as a project for a Python bootcamp, but I decided it would be cool to eventually evolve it into multiplayer
 go moku, Pente, or even variants of Connect-4.
 
-Currently, it is a prototype for two players, but the foundation for large numbers of players is already there. It is on my
-list to implement soon.
+The newest prototype is a working multiplayer prototype. Just make sure the player's names do not start with the same initial.
 
 This Tic-Tac-Toe version uses a multilayer dictionary to sort sets of winning moves. It uses a set to store open spaces remaining
 on the board. It uses a single layer dictionary to assign sets of players moves to the key, the player's name.
